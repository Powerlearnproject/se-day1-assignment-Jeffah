#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems in a structured and efficient manner.

Importance in the Technology Industry:

1.Ensures software reliability, efficiency, and security.
2.Supports the development of scalable and maintainable applications.
3.Reduces development costs and time through structured methodologies.
4.Enables innovation in industries such as healthcare, finance, and eCommerce.
5.Ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering – Marked the birth of software engineering as a discipline, addressing the "software crisis" of unmanageable and unreliable software.
2.Development of Structured Programming (1970s) – Introduced practices like modular design, reducing complexity and improving software maintainability.
3.Agile Manifesto (2001) – Shifted the focus from rigid, document-heavy processes to iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Requirement Analysis – Understanding business needs and defining project scope.
2.Planning – Establishing timelines, resources, and cost estimation.
3.Design – Creating architecture and UI/UX design.
4.Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual code.
5.Testing – Verifying the software meets requirements and is bug-free.
6.Deployment – Releasing the software for users.
7.Maintenance – Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature 	Waterfall   	                Agile
Approach	Sequential	                   Iterative & Incremental
Flexibility	Rigid, changes are difficult	   Highly adaptable to changes
Customer Involvement	Minimal until the final stage	Continuous feedback and collaboration
Delivery	Final product at the end	               Frequent releases with updates
Best for	Large projects with clear requirements (e.g., military, banking software)	Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., startups, mobile apps)
Examples:

Waterfall – A government agency developing a compliance-based system with fixed requirements.

Agile – A startup developing a mobile app with frequent customer feedback.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code. Translates requirements into functional software.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software reliability through testing, identifying bugs, and verifying functionality.

Project Manager – Oversees timelines, coordinates teams, manages risks, and ensures project goals are met.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one platform.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.

Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, enable collaboration, and prevent conflicts.
Examples: Git (with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity – Use modular design and design patterns.

Debugging & Bug Fixes – Employ automated testing and debugging tools.

Keeping Up with New Technologies – Continuous learning via courses, blogs, and conferences.

Time Management – Use Agile methodologies and productivity tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).

Collaboration Issues – Improve communication using version control and collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, GitHub).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components for correctness.

Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.

System Testing – Verifies the entire system meets requirements.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms the system meets business needs and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear and effective prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate responses.

Importance:

Enhances AI accuracy and relevance.

Reduces ambiguity in AI interactions.

Improves automation and efficiency in tasks like content creation and coding.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between machine learning and deep learning, including real-world examples."

Why It’s More Effective?

Specific – Focuses on machine learning vs. deep learning.

Clear – Avoids broad or ambiguous phrasing.

Concise – Removes unnecessary words while keeping the intent clear.
